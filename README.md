WORK IN PROGRESS!

Instructions:
1. Clone this repository into your directory.
2. Install Pulp into your Python Virtual Environment.
3. Run the program via:
```
python scheduler.py
```
4. It can take up to a minute, but your new schedule will be outputted in prediction.txt.

Better constraints and more functionality coming soon.

Note: This script currently only generates schedules based on 2025 matchups.
